Reinforcement learning project made with [Unity Machine Learning Agents Toolkit](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents). 
Agents control throttle, steering, front and rear brakes. Observations include the motorcyle state (motor torque, brake torque, steering angle, velocity, angular velocity, inclination) and a front-facing [grid sensor](https://github.com/mbaske/grid-sensor). Agents are rewarded for speed and penalized for driving off road and collisions.
  
The project contains a few freely available code libs and 3D models:
